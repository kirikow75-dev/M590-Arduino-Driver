Lightweight asynchronous driver for the **M590 GSM modem** for Arduino platforms.

The library is built around a **Finite State Machine (FSM)** and provides fully **non-blocking modem control** without using `delay()`.

Designed for **reliable embedded systems and long-running devices**.

Example connection:

 LGT8F328P Mini                  M590

** R=100 - resistor 100 Ohm 0,1W (0603).

WARNING!
I. The M590 modem requires a **stable power supply capable of handling current peaks** during transmission.
II.The LGT8F328P-Mini board is designed for 3-5V power, while the M490 modem operates on 3.3-4.5V. 
However, due to the M590 modem's potential peak current consumption of up to 2A, it is recommended 
to use separate power supply circuits. In this setup, the LGT8F328P's supply voltage should be at 
least 3.3V and not exceed the M590's supply voltage to ensure logical level voltage compatibility.

# Driver Architecture

The driver is implemented as a **Finite State Machine (FSM)**.

All modem communication is processed inside the `process()` function.

This architecture provides:

* non-blocking execution
* deterministic timing
* reliable modem communication
* safe integration into embedded systems

The FSM advances step-by-step every time `process()` is called.

---

# Driver Workflow

The driver works asynchronously and **must be serviced continuously**.

The application must call:

```
modem.process();
```

inside the main loop.

The driver **can process only one command at a time** and **does not implement a command queue**.

Before sending a new command, the application must ensure the driver is free.

Driver state can be checked using:

```
modem.isBusy()
```

---

# Typical Usage Pattern

```
void loop() {

    modem.process();

    if (modem.isBusy())
        return;

    if (modem.isIncomingSMS()) {

        // Process received SMS here

        modem.clearIncomingSMS();
        return;
    }

}
```

This pattern guarantees that:

* the modem FSM runs continuously
* only one command executes at a time
* commands do not overlap

# Examples

## Sending SMS

```
void loop() {

	static bool flagSend = false;
	
    modem.process();

    if (modem.isBusy())
        return;

    if (!flagSend) {
		modem.sendSMS("+1234567890", "Hello!");
		flagSend = true;
		return;
	}
}
```

---

## Receiving SMS

```
void loop() {

    modem.process();

    if (modem.isBusy())
        return;

    if (modem.isIncomingSMS()) {

        String sms = modem.getSMS();

        // Process message

        modem.clearIncomingSMS();
        return;
    }

}
```

# Important Notes

* The driver **does not support multiple simultaneous commands**
* Always check `isBusy()` before starting a new command
* `process()` must be called **as frequently as possible**
* Commands must not overlap

# Design Goals

This driver was designed for:

* reliable embedded systems
* non-blocking Arduino applications
* autonomous devices running for long periods
* simple integration into existing projects
